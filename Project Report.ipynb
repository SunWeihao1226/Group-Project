    "Rice is one of the most popular grain products in the world and it plays an important role in both nutrition and cultural and regional agriculture. There are many species of rice that are grown in different countries and different species can be distinguished by many characteristics such as physical properties, cooking features, taste, and others. These characteristics are usually used for quality criteria examination or determination of various types. However, it might be inefficient to proceed using some of these characteristics. Therefore, according to many studies, physical properties are found to be useful and less time-consuming."

    "In our project, we will concentrate on the prediction of different rice types based on information on the appearance of the rice and its accuracy. We will focus on two rice species in Turkey—Osmancik and Cammeo—as well as several physical properties of each species. In general, these two species are distinct in shape, texture, and color. This thus poses the question:\n",

    "We will seek to answer this question by using the Rice (Cammeo and Osmancik) Data Set. This data set includes certified rice samples in both species collected by Ilkay Cinar and Murat Koklu in Turkey. The data was obtained and calculated by taking images of the two species. It contains seven numeric variables: Area, Perimeter, Major Axis Length, Minor Axis Length, Eccentricity, Convex Area, and Extent, and one categorical variable: Class."
